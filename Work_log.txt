Reading through the documentation -- specs
Reading through test scripts
Tracing definitions for methods
Reading documentation on external requirements

2017-07-04
Further reading of documentation and scripts
Briefly look through smoke test checklist
Observe how the software is tested for defects wrt the requirements
Visual Studio used to edit and run code

2017-07-05
TEDotNet -- program for running scripts -- connects to device
tmx files for organizing scripts
Smoke vs. sanity tests
HUT (hardware usage tracking) tests

2017-07-06
Visual Studio
Exquisitor -- teaching, various connection methods,
Smoke test (continuation)
Create sequence of scripts (VS -- TM developer)


2017-07-07
Looked at template for test scripts
Analyzed diagnostic script template
Ran diagnostic tests (LP1.2, after its hardware tests)
Several errors:
1. closing the door? power distribution uneven
2. software version not supported by instrument

2017-07-11
Went through orientation classes (7)
Smoke test continuation (deleting and reinstalling protocol)
Updated sequence 4.1, 6.1, 7
Observe how to check if ErrorLibrary & SelfTestList.xml is the latest
Observing export data testing (crash from sending email)
Two sets of libraries--non integrated commands/methods.

2017-07-12
Updated bank details
Browsed Command lib.
Coffee talk with VP (DGG H1FY17 performance)
	PD-L1, Immunohistochemistry (IHC), Waterfall charts, oligonucleotides, polyclonal antibodies
	Focus on expanding to China and Mexico
	Integrating Dako into existing Agilent infrastructure
Tera Term -- terminal emulator
Look through scripts for RunPro and AbortRun.
Immunotherapy -- passive vs. active
Polyclonal vs. monoclonal antibodies

2017-07-13
Smoke test
Verify labware runs
Format strings (c, d, e, and others)
Decontamination defect -- huT (UV 63h)
Read() vs. ReadLine()

2017-07-14
Browsed C#:
	Dictionaries
	Order of declarations
	Naming -- Pascal for class and camel for variables
	Delegates, annonymous functions, lambda expressions
Git, GitHub Desktop, Powershell -- for scripting (?) like VBScript?

2017-07-17
Run test cases using XTHS protocol and HaloPlex.
Run testings for ?custom build (beta2)
Verifies default services for user using HaloPlex-HS
Run script for XTHS to verify protocol
Verified teaching points
Bypass Labware/Enable Error Simulation via AppSettings
Begin script for one of the tests


2017-07-18
Update the firmware with a custom build.
Delete the protocols and re-import them.
Create my own test scripts for some of the verifications.
Go through XTHS protocol and Decontamination procedure.
Learn to create sequences and debug test scripts (NightTest).
ControlSettings contain the Decontamination time.

2017-07-19
Teaching for LP2 to check for any problems (only the old Exquisitor is compatible)
Run protocol 1-5
Short protocol initially encountered errors due to Configuration file (true setting for requiring NaOH)
Copy RawData, ErrorLog, DebugLog, EventLog in the event of an defect/bug.
UserPreferences contain TipSensing.

2017-07-20
Check for correct protocol method:
**Placed inside SetupAllSetup
Red Cargo for updating ONLY firmware.
Zip files contain FW, ExquisitorCompact, and Touchscreen files.
ErrorHandling protocol run
PCR Hot Top Compression -- speed too slow?
AppSettings\AutoTeachSetting -- set to false to disable error.
VerifyAutoTeaching & RunProVTP -- to verify teaching points repeated/run a protocol and verify teaching points after.
RunDiagnostic actually verifies teaching point as well.

Placed in 3 small methods:
**ScrollUp()
**ScrollDown()
**GetNumOfProtocols()
**IsProtocolViewable(string protocolname)
The methods work together to allow RunProtocol scripts to work in the case that the list of protocol is too long
(such that the lowest protocol is un-choosable).

ErrorHandler_6 & ErrorHandler_7 display error messages due to lack of error window after error is triggered.
RunProtocol_2 initially has an error; however further tests cannot replicate the error.
**IsProtocolViewable edited to prevent error from occuring when # of protocols imported < 9.
Worked on online courses -- completed 4.

2017-07-26
Worked on online courses -- completed 2.
Attempted to figure out cause for errors for ErrorHandler_6 & ErrorHandler_7.
New custom build -- RunPro, no message for closing tabs when protocol is finished.

2017-07-27
Worked on online courses -- completed 
Key terms: ERS, SRS, TFS, traceability matrix, test case, test plan, 
ERS (External Reference Specification): focuses on specific modules of the instrument (eg. Bluejay touchscreen)
SRS (System REquirements Specification): focuses on the entire instrument as a system
Traceability matrix: tracks requirements and makes sure requirements for current project are met; many to many
Test case: specific to a single scenario
Test plan: a general outline for the testing project

Run SmokeTest for ver.1.0.1707.2751
	-Graph PCR using multiple text files from RunTimeLog
	-Upload test for defects (TFS)
Forgot to uncheck readonly property of LabwareList --> unable to run protocol.
Attended meeting --> look at minutes in email for details.

Wrote method:
**EnableIHC(bool ihcIsEnabled)
Finalized Smoke Test results
Tested for some defects on 1.0.1707.2751 (LP1.1)
Observed Auto-teaching for LP1.2
Performed user_story tests on LP2 and LP3.
Ran HaloPlex, XTHS, and Parallel during the night.

2017-08-01
Ran sequence A_sprint_5: RunDiagnostics1-11,16.
Some problems with the SelfTestList.
Modified a few lines to update script to match with current firmware.
Run through A_sprint_5 again without Exportfiles_7, 14-18.
