Run test cases using XTHS protocol and HaloPlex.
Run testings for ?custom build (beta2)
Verifies default services for user using HaloPlex-HS
Run script for XTHS to verify protocol
Verified teaching points
Bypass Labware/Enable Error Simulation via AppSettings
Begin script for one of the tests

2017-07-18
Update the firmware with a custom build.
Delete the protocols and re-import them.
Create my own test scripts for some of the verifications.
Go through XTHS protocol and Decontamination procedure.
Learn to create sequences and debug test scripts (NightTest).
ControlSettings contain the Decontamination time.

2017-07-19
Teaching for LP2 to check for any problems (only the old Exquisitor is compatible)
Run protocol 1-5
Short protocol initially encountered errors due to Configuration file (true setting for requiring NaOH)
Copy RawData, ErrorLog, DebugLog, EventLog in the event of an defect/bug.
UserPreferences contain TipSensing.

2017-07-20
Check for correct protocol method:
**Placed inside SetupAllSetup
Red Cargo for updating ONLY firmware.
Zip files contain FW, ExquisitorCompact, and Touchscreen files.
ErrorHandling protocol run
PCR Hot Top Compression -- speed too slow?
AppSettings\AutoTeachSetting -- set to false to disable error.
VerifyAutoTeaching & RunProVTP -- to verify teaching points repeated/run a protocol and verify teaching points after.
RunDiagnostic actually verifies teaching point as well.

2017-07-21


2017-07-24
Placed in 3 small methods:
**ScrollUp()
**ScrollDown()
**GetNumOfProtocols()
**IsProtocolViewable(string protocolname)
The methods work together to allow RunProtocol scripts to work in the case that the list of protocol is too long
(such that the lowest protocol is un-choosable).

CNU347C0ND.mys.agilent.com (computer name of TESTPC)

2017-07-25
ErrorHandler_6 & ErrorHandler_7 display error messages due to lack of error window after error is triggered.
RunProtocol_2 initially has an error; however further tests cannot replicate the error.
**IsProtocolViewable edited to prevent error from occuring when # of protocols imported < 9.
Worked on online courses -- completed 4.

2017-07-26
Worked on online courses -- completed 2.
Attempted to figure out cause for errors for ErrorHandler_6 & ErrorHandler_7.
New custom build -- RunPro, no message for closing tabs when protocol is finished.

2017-07-27
Worked on online courses -- completed ???
Key terms: ERS, SRS, TFS, traceability matrix, test case, test plan, 
ERS (External Reference Specification): focuses on specific modules of the instrument (eg. Bluejay touchscreen)
SRS (System Requirements Specification): focuses on the entire instrument as a system
Traceability matrix: tracks requirements and makes sure requirements for current project are met; many to many
Test case: specific to a single scenario
Test plan: a general outline for the testing project

Run SmokeTest for ver.1.0.1707.2751
	-Graph PCR using multiple text files from RunTimeLog
	-Upload test for defects (TFS)
Forgot to uncheck readonly property of LabwareList --> unable to run protocol.
Attended meeting --> look at minutes in email for details.

2017-07-31
Wrote method:
**EnableIHC(bool ihcIsEnabled)
Finalized Smoke Test results
Tested for some defects on 1.0.1707.2751 (LP1.1)
Observed Auto-teaching for LP1.2
Performed user_story tests on LP2 and LP3.
Ran HaloPlex, XTHS, and Parallel during the night.

2017-08-01
Ran sequence A_sprint_5: RunDiagnostics1-11,16.
Some problems with the SelfTestList.
Modified a few lines to update script to match with current firmware.
Run through A_sprint_5 again without Exportfiles_7, 14-18.

2017-08-02
Debugged A_sprint_5.
Made modifications to several files.
Helped Sim run SmokeTest_2 on LP3 with independent Exquisitor.

2017-08-03
Continue debugging A_sprint_5.
Wrote a variation of existing method:
**btnLeft_1()
Started user story again:
1. HaloPlex (Service, abort protocol)
2. HaloPlex (StdUser, error simulation)
3. HaloPlex (StdUser, complete protocol)
4. XTHS (alson/advance, complete protocol)
Started on writing a script for user_story_3 (HaloPlex, complete protocol).

2017-08-04
Finished up 3 & 4 of user story and compiled results into respective folders.
Finished debugging A_sprint_5 and compiled results for individual sections of sequence.
Sent out invitation for internship presentation.
Started on internship presentation -- powerpoint and research into content.

2017-08-07
Further debugging required on A_sprint_5.
Modifications to:
**RunDiagnostic_Test_CheckboxStatus (string input)
**RunDiagnostic_TestAll_CheckboxStatus()
**SetupAllSetup_XTHS()
Ran XTHS user story on LP1.2.

2017-08-08
Merged the two existing solutions together (CommandLib & scripts).
Working on re-setting up version/source control for test solution.

2017-08-09
Verifying the merge solution by running several sequences.
One conflict between the scripts and the firmware is the BypassHardware property --> scripts did not reset the property to false.
Sequences ran today:
1. A_sprint_4
2. A_sprint_5
3. A_sprint_6
4. SmokeTest2
Removed email script from A_sprint_6.
No progress made on getting source control for test scripts + further verification needed for merge solution.

Documentation options:
*Sphinx (reStructuredText) 
*Daring Fireball (Markdown)
*Latex
Sidenote: Sphinx also supports Latex

2017-08-11
Halfday due to Annual Dinner.
Worked on verifying several test cases using Keam Seng's build:
1. RunDiagnostic
2. DiagnosticRptExplorer
3. IHC
Created an Excel sheet to keep track of verification on R1A scripts.

2017-08-14
Convert some test cases to scripts (specifically 356600 - 356609) w/ Chi Han.
Added method:
**RebootReconnect()

2017-08-15
Successfully get source control back onto 1/2 test PCs with latest test scripts.
Chi Han finishes automating the test cases for IHC and Autoteaching.

2017-08-16
Connected 2/2 test PCs to source control.
Straighten out some weird issues with executing the solution after using source control:
-Executable file not pointed to in debug settings
-TMX file unconnected from designer CS file; thus sequences don't update
Updated solution with scripts and modifications by Chi Han.

2017-08-17
Practiced coding C# with Code Wars.
Reviewed internship presentation.
Feedback:
-Highs vs. lows
-Sometimes the mundane tasks are necessary as these are what gives the project its foundation.

2017-08-18
Wrote scripts for ERS-010, specifically:
-CaptureSize_18
-CaptureSize_17
-CaptureSize_16
-CaptureSize_15
-CaptureSize_14
-CaptureSize_13
Added method:
**RP_ReplaceCaptureSize(string protocolName, string protocolVer, string newCapSize)
Chi Han added some scripts and new methods relating to Capture Size.
